adds various anti air machine gun turrets.

[h1] Language[/h1] 
English, Chinese, Korean and Japanese language are supported.

[h1]Description[/h1] 
this mod adds variety of manned machine gun turrets and flak guns.
To make machine gun turret, you need to make gun crate first at machining table and use it to build the turrets. 
when deconstructed,turrets drop its gun crate. use 2 gun crates to make twin machine gun, or 4 to make quadruple gun.	
	
most of the turrets need to be manned and require ammo to fire.	
[h1]Update[/h1] 
[i]--------version 1.4--------[/i]
GAU17 and GAU19 are added.
[i]--------version 1.3--------[/i]
gun crate's mass and turret's mass are adjusted. they now weigh the same as the real weapon.
you now need to research blowback instead of gas operation to unlock maxim. so it is now easier to get it.  M2 browning still requires gas operation.
gun crates and their ammo are hided from crafting menu of machining table until you unlock the turret for them.

[i]--------version 1.2--------[/i]
Chinese and Japanese translation are added.

[i]--------version 1.1--------[/i]
M2 Browning machine gun turret is added.
